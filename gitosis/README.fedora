After the installation of gitosis, the gitosis-admin repository needs to be
initialized:
# sudo -H -u gitosis gitosis-init <SSH_KEY.pub
whereas SSH_KEY.pub is a your ssh public key, see ssh-keygen(1).

Git repositories can now be configured in gitosis.conf:
$ git clone gitosis@SERVER:gitosis-admin.git

See README.rst for more information.
